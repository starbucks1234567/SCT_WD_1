This is my 1st task in web development as a Skillcraft tech intern!

This task involves creating a fixed navigation menu that remains visible across all pages.
The menu changes its color or style when the user scrolls the page or hovers over menu items, enhancing user interaction and improving website usability through CSS transitions and JavaScript event handling.
